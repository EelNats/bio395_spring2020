Course description
------------------
Between Electronic Medical Records and Electronic Health Records, PubMed, and collections of biomedical grant
applications, there exist large quantities of medical information stored in databases waiting to be explored.
Besides tables of numbers, medical records also contain a great amount of free-text paragraphs that are
comprehensible by human readers but challenging to the computers. Text mining is an interdisciplinary area that
primarily combines advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine
Learning (ML) to help the computers understand human written language, and thus extract medical and clinical
information from free-text records. 

This class aims at introducing fundamental applications in text mining such as
named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction, passage retrieval and document classification.
The class is oriented towards hands-on experience with Python and popular text mining packages such as NLTK and spaCy.
